# **Objective**
The goal of this repository is to introduce a simple game simulation to track the user's a)time in response b) correct rate. At the end of the game,the program saves and sums up the result of the user. Based on the analysis a number of implications regarding the physical and mental condition of the user can be drawn. 

# **How it Works**
The user is presented two pictures consisting of a whole picture and a crop of the whole picture at the same time. The user has to click on the square of the whole picture identical from the crop. 
The picture is drawn randomly. The game is repeated for ten times.

At the end of the game, the program saves the results, analysis presents the following as a scatter plots:

- Average Score
- Response Time

And a graph of the Correct Rate vs image crop entropy.

# **Implications**
With the condition that the user is using the game a number of times in a day on a regular basis, following implications can be drawn: 

1. Implication: 
A decline of response time and correct rate can imply either a loss of motivation or indicate physical tiredness. If the motivation for the game can be controlled with a self-questionnaire right after the game, physical tiredness of the user can be indicated. Specifically for workers with heavy use of computers, this can be implemented. 

2. Implication: 
A decline of response time and correct rate over a long time period coupled with a self-questionnaire can indicate a possible burnout. 

# **Further Developments**
Coupled with a self-questionnaire that asks the motivation of the user and what the user thinks is the reason for the decline/improvement in response time and correctness, the user can be made aware of themselves and identify if they are tired, burnt out. Being aware of their own emotional and physical conditions and identifying their stressors can help users to become morm mindful, which in the long term can benefit their mental and phycial health.
